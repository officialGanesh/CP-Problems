###### 0,1,1,2,3,5....

#### 4️⃣ Linear Search in python
###### Linear search
A linear search or sequential search is a method for finding an element within a list. 
It sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched.
Linear search is rarely practical because other search algorithms and schemes, such as the binary search algorithm and hash tables, allow significantly faster searching for all but short lists.

Worst-case performance:O(n)
Best-case performance:O(1)
Average performance:O(n/2)
Worst-case space complexity:O(1) iterative

#### 5️⃣ Binary Search in python
###### Binary Search 
Binary search also known as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop, is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array.
Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. If they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half, again taking the middle element to compare to the target value, and repeating this until the target value is found. 

Worst-case performance:O(log n)
Best-case performance:O(1)
Average performance:O(log n)
Worst-case space complexity:O(1)

#### 6️⃣ Bubble sort in python
Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. 
The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.
The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way smaller or larger elements "bubble" to the top of the list.
This simple algorithm performs poorly in real world use and is used primarily as an educational tool. 
More efficient algorithms such as quicksort, timsort, or merge sort are used by the sorting libraries built into popular programming languages such as Python and Java.

Worst-case performance:O(n^2) comparisons, O(n^2) swaps
Best-case performance:O(n) comparisons, O(1) swaps
Average performance:O(n^2) comparisons, O(n^2) swaps
Worst-case space complexity:O(n) total, O(1) auxiliary
