#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Factorial using Recursion
##### Factorial of any number n (say)
###### n*(n-1)*(n-2)....3*2*1

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Fibonacci using Recursion
###### 0,1,1,2,3,5....

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Linear Search in python
###### Linear search
A linear search or sequential search is a method for finding an element within a list. 
It sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched.
Linear search is rarely practical because other search algorithms and schemes, such as the binary search algorithm and hash tables, allow significantly faster searching for all but short lists.
Worst-case performance:O(n)
Best-case performance:O(1)
Average performance:O(n/2)
Worst-case space complexity:O(1) iterative
