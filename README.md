#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Linear Search in python
###### Linear search
A linear search or sequential search is a method for finding an element within a list. 
It sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched.
Linear search is rarely practical because other search algorithms and schemes, such as the binary search algorithm and hash tables, allow significantly faster searching for all but short lists.

Worst-case performance:O(n)
Best-case performance:O(1)
Average performance:O(n/2)
Worst-case space complexity:O(1) iterative

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Binary Search in python
###### Binary Search 
Binary search also known as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop, is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array.
Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. If they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half, again taking the middle element to compare to the target value, and repeating this until the target value is found.
